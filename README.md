A light theme in white and blue with focus on readibility. It uses a full screen where neccessary but takes into account small screens too. Since webtrees 1 this theme is optimized for using on tablets and mobile phones. Now webtrees 2 has implemented that by default. But still this theme has some extra's.

Description
-----------
This is a modern theme in clean white and blue. Originally it was designed to give the user a better experienced on touch devices liked tablets and mobile phones. To achieve this we use the Bootstrap framework in this theme.

Webtrees didn't ignore the success of this theme and recognized the need to upgrade the core to meet nowadays user demands. And I am glad they did. Webtrees 2 has adopted the same Bootstrap framework and works smootly now on mobile phones and tablets.

Is this theme become superflous now? No! It still has enough fans to make it worth upgrading. At the end it is all a matter of taste.

Since the core code has changed a lot I've made some concessions. Webtrees 2 required a complete rewrite of this theme and for sake of simplicity some features will not return. This also counts for the theme option module. If there is a lot of need for special options I might consider to bring it back but at the moment I don't feel the need.
